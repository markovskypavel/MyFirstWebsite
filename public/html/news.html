					<h2><u>12.12.2017</u>: Never Ending Snow Storms Force Silverton Mountain</h2>
					<p>December 11, 2017…. The 2017-18 Alaska heli season has been an incredible one as Silverton Mountain Guides Alaska Heli opened for the season way back on October 24th with an incredibly deep 15 foot base of snow! December has seen a steady and continuous parade of huge storms pounding Alaska day after day with intense amounts of snow piling up at elevation.</p>
					<p>A recent report from the NWS cataloged snow rates of 10" per hour which is an astounding snow rate intensity. Rates of 10" per hour could stack up to 240" in a single day! During huge Alaskan storm cycles like this one it is not uncommon to receive 15-20+ feet of new snow at 4,000' and above.</p>
					<p>Silverton Mountain Guides Alaska Heli was founded in 2008 and has several bases of operation including Seward, Girdwood, Palmer, and Petersburg, Alaska. Silverton Mountain Guides Alaska Heli holds the most terrain in the US including the vast and expansive Neacola, Tordrillo, Northern Chugach, Kenai, and Coast mountains. Open Nov-May each season, Silverton Mountain Guides is the only Alaska Heli boarding operation that is operational during the months of November, December and January which typically hold some of the best powder conditions of the season. Long range forecasts are hinting about a change in the weather starting around December 18th and conditions are going to be incredible when the sun comes out!</p>

					<h2><u>16.11.2017</u>: Dew Tour Debuts World Para Snowboard Adaptive Snowboard Competition Presented by Toyota</h2>
					<p> Dew Tour's WPSB competition, presented by Toyota and in partnership with World Para Snowboard, Adaptive Action Sports and the U.S. Paralympic Association will take place on Friday, December 15 as part of the annual ski and snowboard competition and festival. Already confirmed to compete is Toyota's star adaptive snowboarding athlete and U.S. Paralympic Bronze medalist Amy Purdy. WPSB and Adaptive Action Sports, the action sports organization co-founded by Purdy and her husband Daniel Gale, have teamed up with Dew Tour to serve as the sport organizers of the competition. Last year marked the first time adaptive snowboarding was featured at Winter Dew Tour.</p>
					<p>“I am so thrilled that we will be heading into our second year of the Dew Tour," said Purdy. "I was not able to compete last year due to injury, but I will be there this year to compete along side all the amazing athletes on the adaptive circuit. We continue to partner with Toyota in so many ways that have helped to grow and elevate our sport. Toyota has provided ongoing support and exposure for the world to see what is possible and I am so proud to be a Team Toyota athlete.”</p>
					<p>"We are honored to collaborate with partners Toyota, WPSB, Adaptive Action Sports and Breckenridge to hold our second year of adaptive competition at Dew Tour," said Adam Cozens, Vice President and GM of Dew Tour. "Last year's competition was inspiring and intense as the athletes battled in snowy conditions on the course. Veteran Dew Tour athletes and fans enthusiastically embraced the addition to the event. We're excited that the stakes take on a larger global stance this year with the event serving as a Nor Am and we can't wait to see these amazing athletes in their element at Dew Tour."</p>
					<p>Dew Tour's World Para Snowboard Nor Am competition presented by Toyota will bring more than 30 of the best WPSB snowboarding athletes in the world to Breckenridge to compete individually in a banked slalom course designed specifically for this competition in an effort to gain valuable Paralympic qualifying points. Finals will take place on Friday, December 15 at 10 am MT; the format will consist of three runs with the best run counting for the final ranking. For fans tuning in to dewtour.com, coverage of the competition will be livestreamed on the webcast.</p>

					<h2><u>01.11.2017</u>: WINTER OLYMPIC SLOPESTYLE COURSE PREVIEW</h2>
					<p>We are officially 100 Days out from the 2018 Winter Olympics, so like it or not, the Olympic season is here! The PyeongChang Games will start on February 9th and run until the 25th with over 84 countries competing, assuming that Donald Trump will not pull the U.S. out of our agreement to participate. No matter how you feel about the governing bodies that be, it is always exciting to see what the course will look like, and this year is no different. The 2018 Winter Olympic Slopestyle course designed by Schneestern, a German-based company, has a few NBD’s, so we thought we would give you a quick walkthrough below.</p>
					<p>Who will take the top spot? We haven’t officially heard if the 2014 Olympic gold medalist Sage Kotsenburg is returning, but our guess is that he will not be. The field is wide open for any of the big names to take it, and hopefully creativity will be rewarded on this setup. Mark McMorris, Marcus Kleveland, Stale Sandbech, Jamie Anderson, Anna Gasser, Sven Thorgren, Mikey Ciccarelli, Red Gerard, Brandon Davis, and many more will likely duke it out come February for a chance to represent their country on top of the podium, and we will be updating you along the whole way.</p>
