<p>While the sport battled for acceptance, major mainstream brands were investing in contest events, and the skiing community gradually acknowledged snowboarding’s critical contribution to the revival of the snow resort industry. Snowboarding was finally recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1994 and debuted at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, in 1998. This breakthrough with the Olympics was greeted with mixed emotions by snowboarders; in fact, three-time world champion snowboarder Terje Håkonsen of Norway boycotted the Olympic Games because of a disagreement with the IOC.</p>
<p>At the 1998 Games, four events (two for men and two for women) were held in two specialties: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the halfpipe, in which competitors performed tricks while going from one side of a semicircular pipe to the other. Overall, the sport’s debut was lacklustre, with the halfpipe contest airing during the middle of the night in the United States and with the disqualification of giant slalom winner Ross Rebagliati of Canada, whose victory was negated when he later tested positive for marijuana (a disqualification that was subsequently overturned).</p>
<p>Snowboarding’s reception at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City was quite different. The halfpipe event was broadcast as a prime-time event in the U.S., and Americans dominated the winner’s podium. At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, the halfpipe was again the centrepiece of the Games, along with the debut of a new event, the “snowboard cross” (originally and still frequently called boardercross), in which competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, berms, and other obstacles. Then, at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver, mainstream interest in the halfpipe reached fever pitch. American snowboarding superstar Shaun White captivated the crowd by landing the first ever double McTwist 1260 (two flips while completing three-and-a-half twists) in competition, while this author enjoyed the thrill of winning the women’s gold medal in this event.</p>
