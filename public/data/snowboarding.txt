<p><u>Snowboarding</u> is a fairly young sport and extreme pastime, which managed to get into the program of the Olympic Games due to its spectacularity, immense popularity and a multitude of options and directions for the development of snowboarding athletes. Important and special, with little comparable atmosphere, accompanying any skating, whether it be professional competitions of international level or quiet descent from the skiing tracks of Belarus.</p>
<p>Snowboarding owes its existence to restless serfs, who did not have much time to attach wheels to their boards and begin to ride the streets - the most desperate began to use the potential of snow-covered mountain slopes, thus giving rise to a sporting direction that became, if not the meaning of life, at least a very important part of it for many people regardless of age, sex and country of residence.</p>
